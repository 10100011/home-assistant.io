## Organizing your Home Assistant

By far, the most requested feature in Home Assistant history would be:
[_"Grouping Automations on frontend for organization"_](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/grouping-automations-on-frontend-for-organization/102771).

We hear you! And today, in this release, we are going to give you tools to
organize your Home Assistant setup. We want to make it easier for everyone, not
just to organize, but also to view and find the things you need.

However, we took it a few (well many) steps further than just grouping
automations. We are introducing 3 new organization structures to Home Assistant:

**[Floors](#floors)**, **[Labels](#labels)**, and **[Categories](#categories)**.

We'll dive into each of these in a moment. First, let's talk about the brand
new user interface for tables.

## Improved user interface for tables

Adding more ways to organize your Home Assistant is great! But being able to
easily view, filter and navigate information is just as important. To achieve
this, we have re-designed ALL the tables in Home Assistant.

Each table has a search bar, allowing you to quickly find what you are
looking for, can be sorted by any column, and has a new look and feel.

Tables now have the possibility to group rows, by for example, their entity
state, and can be filtered! The filters are very powerful and allow you to
only show the rows you are interested in, you could for example filter on
areas, but also on the new organization structures we are introducing today:
floors, labels, and categories.

![CleanShot 2024-03-27 at 16 01 20](https://github.com/home-assistant/frontend/assets/5662298/3aed32c6-dcad-4474-9bbd-97e75e4f98cf)

## Floors of your home

Let's talk about the new organization structures, starting with **floors**.

Currently, Home Assistant has {% term areas %}. Areas can be used to group your
devices per living space in your home (like the living room or kitchen). But
if you look at your home, you might have multiple floors with its own areas.

This is where **floors** come in. Floors are a new way to organize your areas
per level of floors in your home. The better Home Assistant known your home,
and how it is structured, the better it can help you.

<!-- Insert screenshot -->

You can use floors in your automations and script as a target for your
actions. For example, you can turn off all the lights on the downstairs floor
when you go to bed. For our power users, you can even use floors in your
templates to create more advanced automations.

## Label anything

Floors and areas are great to represent your actual home, but what if you
have different needs? This is where **labels** üè∑Ô∏è come in!

Labels is an organization structure that is completely up to you. You can
make as many labels with any naming structure your want and assign them to
basically anything in Home Assistant. You assign labels to area, devices,
entities, automations, scripts, helpers, you name it! You can even assign
multiple labels to the same thing.

![CleanShot 2024-03-27 at 08 46 10@2x](https://github.com/home-assistant/frontend/assets/5662298/582b75af-7352-4241-8bad-3a39873c99c6)

Just like with floors, you can use labels in your automations and scripts as
a target for your actions. This gives you a lot of flexibility, not just in
organizing your Home Assistant, but also in automating your home! ü§Ø

For example, you could create a label "üéÑ Christmas" to label all your
Christmas decorations during the holiday season. You can then use this label
automate all of those decorations at once or to filter them in the new tables.

More examples? You could create a label "üîí Security" to label and control all
your security-related devices and automations. Or, "üõå Bedrooms" to label
all your bedroom areas and control all the devices in those areas at once.

Do you have solar panels or home battery? Create a label "‚ö°Ô∏è Heavy Energy Usage"
to label devices that consume a lot of energy, you could maybe switch them
off when there is not enough battery or solar energy available.

You decide how to use labels, and the possibilities are endless! And for our
power users, you guessed it, you can use labels in your templates.

## Organize using categories

Last but not least, we are introducing **categories**. Categories can be used
to group things in for organization purposes and are specific for a certain
dashboard in Home Assistant.

For example, you can create as many categories as you want on the automations
dashboards, and group your automations in those categories. You can then view
your automations grouped by those categories, or filter them by those categories.

<!-- insert screenshot -->

As these categories are unique for each dashboard, you can have different
sets of categories depending on the place you are organizing. This means
you can have different categories on the automations dashboard than on the
scene, scripts, or helpers dashboard.

## Map dashboard

Introducing a new dashboard type this release: The **map**! üó∫Ô∏è

Now, you might think, "Hey, we already have a map in Home Assistant!" and you
are right. However, the map was an integration that was always there, and wasn't
providing the flexibility and features we wanted.

With the introduction of the map dashboard, it mean you could add multiple map
dashboards with different entities and settings, but you can also just remove
the map if you don't want it.

<!-- insert screenshot -->

On upgrade Home Assistant will automatically migrate your existing map
integration to a map dashboard.

## Webpage dashboard

Another new dashboard type this release: The **webpage**! üåê

The webpage dashboard allows you to add and embed a webpage to your dashboard.
This could be a webpage from the internet, but also a local webpage or a
webpage from a local server.

<!-- insert screenshot -->

This dashboard replaces the old iFrame panel (`iframe_panel`). If you have
existing panels configured in your YAML configuration, Home Assistant will
automatically migrate them to the new webpage dashboard on upgrade.

## Define the columns in the section view

Last release, we [introduced the section view](/blog/2024/03/06/release-20243/#a-new-experimental-sections-view)
with drag and drop support. We are absolutely thrilled to see how many of you
loved it! ü•∞

Many thanks for all the feedback and suggestions! We are prioritizing them and
are working on making the section view even better in the upcoming releases.

This release, based on your feedback, we have added the ability for you to
define the number of columns in the section view is using.

![CleanShot 2024-03-20 at 12 47 17](https://github.com/home-assistant/frontend/assets/5878303/eb35c689-ce64-4a28-bfb0-8f4410677397)

## Adding matter devices from other controllers

We have improved the way you can add Matter devices from other controllers to
Home Assistant. When you add a Matter device to Home Assistant, it will now
ask you if you want to add a new Matter device, or if you want to add an
device that is already added to another controller (like Google or Apple Home).

![CleanShot 2024-03-26 at 10 35 18](https://github.com/home-assistant/frontend/assets/5878303/16ff6c5f-e779-46b1-aafc-cfc9089a25b8)

If you choose to add a device that is already added to another controller,
Home Assistant will guide you through the process of doing that!

![CleanShot 2024-03-26 at 10 35 35](https://github.com/home-assistant/frontend/assets/5878303/cef33fde-7129-4431-aa5a-7ea0aa929976)

## Lock behavior improvements

Unlatching a lock? We want to make sure you don't accidentally open the door
when you miss-clicked the button while not at home. We have improved the
behavior of locks in our user interface to require you to confirm the action.

<video controls>
  <source src="https://github.com/home-assistant/frontend/assets/5878303/6df9c5be-fbfc-4ee3-a84e-7fcfb662b1fc" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

## Even more performance!

Remember how we wrote last release that [Home Assistant now boots twice as fast](/blog/2024/03/06/release-20243/#home-assistant-boots-twice-as-fast)?
Well, [@bdraco] wasn't done yet. If you thought that was fast, you are in for
a treat! üöÄ The difference is, yet again, very noticable.

Besides streamlining what is loaded when at startup (and doing less loading),
we have also adjusted the startup time tracking. It used to be that 1 buggy
integration could push other integrations to be slow too, that should no
longer be the case, making this a more accurate representation of the actual
startup time.

## Backward-incompatible changes

{% details "Python 3.11 support has been removed" %}

Python 3.11 support has previously been deprecated and has now been removed.
Home Assistant now requires Python 3.12 to run.

You don‚Äôt have to do anything if you are using the Home Assistant Operating
System, Home Assistant Container, or Home Assistant Supervised installation
method. In those cases, we handle this all for you. Your system has been
using Python 3.12 for quite some time already.

in the middle:

- `rising quickly` -> `rising_quickly`
- `rising slightly` -> `rising_slightly`
- `falling slightly` -> `falling_slightly`
- `falling quickly` -> `falling_quickly`

{% details "MQTT" %}

Support for `brightness` is now assumed for `mqtt` lights with the `json` schema
unless only color modes `rgb`, `rgbw` or `rgbww` are supported.

For light which only support  color modes `rgb`, `rgbw` or `rgbww`, 
the `brightness` option flag can still be set to `false` if brightness is not
supported, in this case brightness support is emulated in Home Assistant by
scaling the RGBx-values.

For all other color modes except `ColorMode.ONOFF`, it is assumed brightness is
supported and the `brightness` attribute will be included in the MQTT payload
when the `brightness` attribute is supplied to the `light.turn_on` service.
