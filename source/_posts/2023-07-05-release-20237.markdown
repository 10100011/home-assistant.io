Home Assistant Core 2023.7! ðŸŽ‰

The previous release was a big one, and this one is no different!

This release brings in a change to Home Assistant, which we consider to be one
of the biggest game changers of the past years: Services can now respond with
data! ðŸ¤¯

It is such a fundamental change, which will allow for many new use cases and
opens the gates for endless possibilities. I'm so excited about this one!

But that is not all; there is a lot more in store for you! Some of my favorites:
The Bluetooth proxies are now lightning fast, copy 'n paste in dashboards, a new
sentence trigger, and I love that an broken automation no longer disappears
in thin air but now shows up in the UI marked as problematic.

All-in-all, a great release packed with many new features and a lot of
quality-of-life improvements.

Enjoy the release!

Services now can respond with data! ðŸŽ‰

Yes, you read that right! This advanced feature is a huge step forward for
Home Assistant and will allow for a lot of new possibilities.

So, normally, calling a service in an automation or script, is a one-way
communication to control your devices and services. For example, turning on a
light, or play an announcement on your speakers.

So, what is the use of a service responding data? Well, it could be used to
ask for information from a device or service. For example, you could ask
Home Assistant which events are on your calendar today, and and use the
answer from that service call to create a notification or announcement.

<p class='img'>
<img src='https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/427516175237382144/1123597217622663278/CleanShot_2023-06-28_at_14.53.44.png?width=2422&height=1462'></a>
Temporary screenshot that needs to be replaced.
</p>

We have two brand new service to play with:

- {% my developer_call_service service="conversation.process" %} - This
  service allows you to ask Assist a command or question, and get a response
  back.
- {% my developer_call_service service="calendar.list_events" %} - This service
  allows you to ask Home Assistant for a list of events on your calendar.

If you combine those in an automation, in the morning, you could ask
Home Assistant for todays calendar events, add things like weather information,
send it to ChatGPT using the conversation proceess and ask it to summerize it,
and send a notification to your phone with the result.

[@allenporter] has put this all togther in this Blueprint to play with:

<https://gist.github.com/allenporter/e70d9eb090c7dbdd593cf526e07b4abe>

This is just one example, but the possibilities are endless! It is exciting
to see what other creative use cases and new services with response will
be added in the future!

This feature is also added to scripts! So, you can make your scripts
respond and use that script response in your automations. This is a great way
to make your scripts more dynamic and flexible.

A special thanks to [@allenporter], who has been responsible for building out
the larger part of this feature!

## New entity dialog for Locks

We are continuing to improve the entity dialogs. This time, we have reworked
a new dialog for locks. It looks great!

It looks similar to the entity dialog for the switch, but it has a few
extra features like asking for a unlock code and has a beautiful animation
when it is (un)locking.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2023-07/entity-dialog-lock.gif' alt='Screen recording demonstrating the new lock entity dialog.'>

## Sentence trigger

Our [Assist](/voice_control/) is getting more and more powerful! This time,
we have added a new trigger to our automation editor that allows you to
trigger an automation when a sentence is said to the default Assist conversation
agent. ðŸ¤¯

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2023-07/sentence-trigger.png' alt='Screenshot of the new sentence trigger that can be used with automations.'>

Creating an automation based on something that is said, has never been easier.
In the above screenshot, just mentioning "what a mess" will send out the living
room vacuum to start cleaning up the mess.

## Open assist action

Another one for the Year of the Voice, a brand new action for use in dashboard
cards, has been added: The Assist action!

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2023-07/assist-action.png' alt='Screenshot of the new sentence trigger that can be used with automations.'>

With this action, you can directly open Assist from your dashboards using,
for example, a button and even make Assist listen right away.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2023-07/assist-action.gif' alt='Screenshot of the new sentence trigger that can be used with automations.'>
<br /><br />
There are quite a few cases where this action can be useful. For example, if
you have a tablet mounted on the wall, you can use this action to open Assist
and start listening immediately using a single button touch.

## Image entities

There is a brand new entity type in town: The [image entity](/integrations/image/).

The image entity is very similar to the [camera entity](/integrations/camera/),
but instead of providing a live stream, it provides a single image. For example,
a QR code that provides the Wi-Fi credentials for your guest network, a weather
map, an image of the last motion detected by your camera, or just the cute cat
picture of the day!

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2023-07/image-entity.png' alt='Screenshot of an new image entity more information dialog, showing a QR code in the image.'>

While the camera entity provided similar functionality, we wanted to make an
entity tailored for these specific use cases. An image entity is much
more lightweight and efficient compared to the camera entity. Also, this keeps
our camera entities focused on providing actual camera feeds.

Support for this brand new entity has been added to the [AVM Fritz!Box Tools](/integrations/fritz/)
(for guest network access), and the [MQTT](/integrations/mqtt/) and
[Template](/integrations/template/) integrations if you want to build your own.

## Energy dashboard: Self-sufficiency

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2023-07/self-sufficiency.png' alt='Screenshot showing the latest updates and tweaks made to the integrations dashboard, making it less busy.'>

## Copy 'n paste support in dashboards

{% details "TODO" %}

- Improve/extend story
- Proof read/spelling/grammar
- Replace screenshot

Sources:

- Show card positions in edit dashboard mode (#17055) @karwosts
- Support cut/copy/paste in dashboard UI editor (#16707) @karwosts

{% enddetails %}

In the previous release, [@karwosts] added the amazing [copy 'n paste feature](/blog/2023/06/07/release-20236/#copy-n-paste-support-in-the-automation-editor)
to our automation and script editors. This release, he is back with the same
feature for our dashboards!

You can now cut, copy, and paste cards between your dashboards, views and
even inside other nested cards. This makes it a lot easier to reorganize your
dashboards!

<p class='img'>
<img src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32912880/242464648-bc2dd476-9acf-4ccf-a615-668f7dd949f1.gif'></a>
Temporary screenshot that needs to be replaced.
</p>

To make it even easier to reorganize your dashboards, it is mandatory to
understand the order of the cards across the differnt columns in your view.
So, a positional number is now shown when the your are in edit mode.

<p class='img'>
<img src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32912880/249232766-b1a35c7c-d596-4cab-83dc-67502b1a3c58.png'></a>
Temporary screenshot that needs to be replaced.
</p>

Added bonus: Who needs drag 'n drop when you've got click 'n ...teleport? Click
on the number and you can input a new position for the card!

## Select the timezone to use/display

You can now select which timezone the Home Assistant interface should use
in your user profile. Useful when traveling or when you, for example,
manage an instance for a relative in a different time zone.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2023-07/choose-used-timezone-in-ui.png' alt='Screenshot showing a new option in the user profile, that allows you to choose if you want Home Assistant to use the server or your current timezone.'>

You choose to use the timezone of your current location, use the timezone that
your Home Assistant server is in. The Home Assistant frontend will adjust all
of the date & times to the selected timezone.

## Iteration of the integrations dashboard

In the last release, we introduced new [integrations dashboard & pages](/blog/2023/06/07/release-20236/#integrations-dashboard--pages),
which many of you really liked. Yet, there has been some feedback, and we
have been working on improving it.

The main goal was to make it feel less busy, more familiar and consistent with
all other UI you see in Home Assistant.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2023-07/integration-dashboard-improvements.png' alt='Screenshot showing the latest updates and tweaks made to the integrations dashboard, making it less busy.'>

The cards shown are now more consistent with the rest of Home Assistant and the
full integration name and logo is now clickable. The cog, device and service
items have been removed, and the indicators for custom integrations
and cloud services are no longer overlap the logos.

## Unavailable automations and scripts

Automations and scripts are awesome! They can add a lot of comfort to your
home, making your home automation feel like magic. But they have a weird quirk;
If you made an error in their configuration, they would just disappear
from Home Assistant. ðŸ˜ž

This is no longer the case! ðŸ˜€ If an automation or script has an error, it will
now show up as unavailable, accompanied by a red confused automation robot.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2023-07/broken-automation.png' alt='Screenshot showing the list of automations, with one broken automation in that list.'>

Selecting such an automation will show you the details of the error message
so you know what is going on and what to fix.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2023-07/broken-automation-details.png' alt='Screenshot showing the automation editor displaying a broken automation, including the error message on what is wrong.'>

## New script dialog

When you create a new automation, youâ€™ll get a nice dialog where you can create
a new one from scratch or use one of your imported blueprints
as a starting point.

[@karwosts] has now added the same dialog to our script editor! ðŸŽ‰

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2023-07/new-script-dialog.png' alt='Screenshot of the dialog shown when creating a new script, allowing you to select blueprints as well.'>

Being able to set up scripts from Blueprints is great, as combined with the
brand new [service response](#services-call-can-now-respond) feature, these
become a lot more powerful and a lot more useful for sharing!

You can find new script Blueprints for you to use in the
[Blueprint Exchange on our community forum](https://community.home-assistant.io/tags/c/blueprints-exchange/53/script?ascending=false&order=views).

## Lightning fast Bluetooth proxies

{% details "TODO" %}

- Improve/extend story
- Proof read/spelling/grammar
- Replace screenshot

- Add support for ESPHome raw bluetooth advertisements ([@bdraco] - [#94138]) ([esphome docs]) (noteworthy)
- Bump bluetooth-data-tools to 1.2.0 ([@bdraco] - [#94696]) ([esphome docs]) ([bluetooth docs]) ([led_ble docs]) ([ld2410_ble docs]) (dependency) (noteworthy)

{% enddetails %}

Bluetooth proxies are now even faster! Like... really fast!
When using the latest ESPHome and this release of Home Assistant, it will
be so much faster that we should actually recommend using over an native
Bluetooth stick.

## Matter updates

Quite a few significant changes have been made to the Matter integration.

The biggest change can be found in the way subscriptions are handled. Especially
on larger (thread) networks, this will result in a much faster and more reliable
experience. This also affects startup time, which is now blazing fast (from
minutes to seconds).

Changes to connected Matter bridges are now instantly detected, so when adding
a new device to a bridge (like, for example, a connected Aqara M2 hub) will
show up immediately.

Last but most certainly not least: The Matter integration now supports
climate devices! ðŸŽ‰

<p class='img'>
<img src='/images/blog/2023-07/matter-climate-nest-thermostat.png'></a>
A Nest Thermostat connected as a Matter climate device.
</p>

This means if you have a [Nest Thermostat](https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/9246551?sjid=11501903403631214779-EU)
with the latest firmware, you can now use it directly with Home Assistant,
entirely local without clouds!

## Reducing the risk of running into breaking changes

Breaking changes, nobody loves them, but they are sometimes necessary to move
forward. We try to keep them to an absolute minimum, but sometimes they are
inevitable.

However, we do want to reduce the risk of running into them. Therefore we have
adopted [a new policy for deprecating YAML integration configuration options][adr].

We now require that a YAML configuration option is deprecated for at least 6
months before being removed. This means you wonâ€™t be running into
a hard-breaking change if you skip a release or two.

To improve this further, if possible, an automatic migration is now required
and an issue in the repairs dashboard will be raised if the deprecation applies
to your configuration.

## Other noteworthy changes

There are much more easter bunnies in this release; here are some of the other
noteworthy changes this release:

- You can now use network storages that have guest access enabled, and support
  for older Samba versions has been added. Thanks, [@ludeeus]!
- When accessing the UI of an add-on via the sidebar that hasn't been
  started yet, it will now ask if you want to start it. Nice,
  [@mdegat01] and [@bramkragten]!
- The HomeKit Controller integration has been renamed to [HomeKit Device];
  this makes it clearer that the integration is to integrate HomeKit devices
  into Home Assistant.
- [ESPHome] now has support for Alarm Control Panels! Thanks [@grahambrown11]!
- [@Petro31] added support for setting upper and lower limits on the
  [compensation integration]. Cool!
- [Humidifiers] now have an attribute for the current humidity, thanks [@Shulyaka]!
  [@jbouwh] updated the [Google Assistant] integration to support this. Additionally,
  he added support to the [Xiaomi Miio], [HomeKit Device], [Tuya] and [MQTT] integrations.
  Awesome!
- [@piitaya] updated all existing Humidier cards to work with the above change,
  and adjusted them to be more in line with the existing climate cards. Nice! 
- The [weather entity] now supports more (forecast) attributes. It added support
  for apparent temperature, dew point, cloud coverage, and wind gust speed;
  Thanks, [@gjohansson-ST], [@vingerha], and [@bieniu]!
- The [Apple TV] integration now supports launching apps with [deep links]!
  Thanks [@michalmo]!
- [@dougiteixeira] adjusted the [Derivative], [Riemann sum integral],
  [Threshold], and [Utility Meter] helper to add the helper to the source device.
  This makes them show up on the device page of the device the helper is using.
  Nice work!
- [Sensirion BLE] now supports the SHT4x and SHT3x sensors, thanks [@akx]!
- The [MQTT][mqtt_water_heater] integration now has support for water heaters,
  thanks [@hookedonunix]!
- [@Lash-L] kept improving the [Roborock] integration and added cleaning area
  sensors and switches to control DnD mode. Thanks!
- We have a new trigger that allows automations to trigger on the creation,
  deletion, or update of [persistent notifications]! Thanks, [@RoboMagus]!
- You can now dismiss all [persistent notifications] at once using the new
  dismiss all service added by [@Petro31]!

## Breaking changes

{% details "Home Assistant Container (Docker)" %}

If you use the Home Assistant Container installation method, for example, using
Docker, please make sure you are using our official (multi-platform) images.

The correct and preferred image to use for our stable releases is:

- `ghcr.io/home-assistant/home-assistant:stable`

Although not the preferred location by the Home Assistant project, the image
is also available on DockerHub:

- `homeassistant/home-assistant:stable`

The reason for mentioning this in this breaking change section is that we have
seen usage of our internal, intermediate, platform build images. These images
are not meant for use directly, and using the above listed images is strongly
recommended.

As of this release, we no longer publish our intermediate platform images to
DockerHub. This means that if you are using these images, you will no longer
receive updates. Please use the above-listed images instead.

{% details "Bose SoundTouch" %}

The previously deprecated YAML configuration of the Bose SoundTouch
integration has been removed.

Bose SoundTouch is now configured via the UI. Any existing YAML
configuration has been imported in previous releases and can now be safely
removed from your YAML configuration files.

{% details "ESPHome" %}

As an additional security hardening measure, the default for allowing ESPHome
devices to make service calls has changed. If you want to permit the ESPHome
device to make service calls, it must be enabled in the options flow.

- For existing devices, calling Home Assistant services continues to be allowed.
- For newly configured devices, it must now be enabled in the options flow.

{% details "Home Assistant Supervisor" %}

The default name given to backups created with the `hassio.full_backup`
and `hassio.partial_backup` services is now longer `""` but the date and time
the backup was initiated (`%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S`, for example,
"2023-07-05 13:37:42").

{% enddetails %}

{% details "MQTT" %}

If the `initial` temperature, `min_temp`, or `max_temp` is not set, the default
temperature will be converted to the set `temperature_unit` or system default
temperature unit if this is not degrees Celsius.

([@jbouwh] - [#93965]) ([documentation](/integrations/mqtt))

[@jbouwh]: https://github.com/jbouwh
[#93965]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/93965

---

The behavior of MQTT climate when `power_command_topic` is set has been changed:

- The `hvac_mode` state attribute is no longer optimistically set if
  `power_command_topic` is defined and `climate.turn_on` or `climate.turn_off`
  is called.
- When `hvac_mode` is changed, `payload_on` or `payload_off` messages will
  not be published on the `power_command_topic`.

This also means `power_command_topic` is no longer deprecated.

([@jbouwh] - [#94832]) ([documentation](/integrations/mqtt))

[@jbouwh]: https://github.com/jbouwh
[#94832]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/94832

{% enddetails %}

{% details "MusicCast" %}

If you have any automation depending on the `source` state attribute of the
media player entity, you will have to update these, because we want to show
