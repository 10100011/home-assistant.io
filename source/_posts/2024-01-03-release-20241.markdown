## Backward-incompatible changes

{% details "Home Assistant shutdown event" %}

The event key in the (undocumented) trigger data for the `homeassistant` trigger
platform is now the string `shutdown` for a `homeassistant` trigger configured
to fire on shutdown instead of an `Event` object.

([@tetele] - [#91165]) ([documentation](/integrations/homeassistant))

[@tetele]: https://github.com/tetele
[#91165]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/91165

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Modbus" %}

Setting `swap: none` has been removed from the Modbus configuration,
it is identical to omitting it: `swap:`.
