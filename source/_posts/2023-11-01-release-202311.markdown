Home Assistant 2023.11! üéâ

It seems like I forgot to come up with a release title for this release and left
a placeholder in the title. If I only could have it on a to-do list somewhere... ü§î

Before we dive into this pretty massive release, I want to quickly look back
at two amazing things that happened in the past month.

First, we presented [chapter 4 of the Year of the Voice](/blog/2023/10/12/year-of-the-voice-chapter-4-wakewords/),
which introduced the new wake word feature in Home Assistant. This really
brings the voice assistant experience to the next level, and we are super
excited about it! Like have you seen the [R5-based voice assistant droid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7Hmeume9g)? üòç

Second, we had a security audit performed on Home Assistant by one of the top
security auditors in the world! You can read all about it in the [blog post](/blog/2023/10/19/security-audits-of-home-assistant/).
A big shout out to everybody subscribed to [Home Assistant Cloud](https://www.nabucasa.com),
as you enable us to do these things! ü•∞

Alright, about this release! It is huge! I love the tile card, and the ability
to easily customize the information it shows now is just. ü§© But mostly, I'm
super stoked about the new to-do lists, which will probably become a very
central part of my household.

Enjoy the release!

## There is a lot to-do!

There are many things to do in our lives, which is what
[@allenporter] realized too! We now have a new entity type
in Home Assistant: [`todo` entities](/integrations/todo)!

A to-do entity represents a list of tasks, and its state is the amount of
uncompleted tasks that are still open. You can create one or more (fully local)
to-do lists and view and manage them by selecting the new **To-do lists**
item in the sidebar.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2023-11/todo-local.png' alt='Screenshot showing the new to-do lists dashboard, where you can manage multiple to-do lists and even create new ones.'>

Besides the entities, there are also new services available allowing you
to automate on your to-do lists as well. Use automations to create, complete, or
clean up tasks on your to-do lists.

So, what can you do with all of this? A lot! For example, you can create
a to-do list for your groceries, automate a list of house chores for your kids
or other household members, or automatically put a task on a list to replace
the batteries of a sensor when it is low. You could even send a push notification
to your phone when you are near the home improvement store and have items on
a to-do list that you need to buy there.

Thanks [@allenporter], and everyone involved, for this amazing addition to
Home Assistant! We can now check this one off from our wishlist! ‚úî

[@allenporter]: https://github.com/allenporter

## Shopping lists are now to-do's too!

These to-do lists look a lot like the shopping list, right? Correct!

They are very much alike, and that is why we have moved the shopping list
to a to-do list as well! Once you upgrade to this release, your existing
shopping list will be automatically converted to a to-do list.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2023-11/todo-shopping-list.png' alt='Screenshot showing the shopping list, which now is a to-do list.'>

But that is not all; we also updated the **Shopping list** card for your
dashboards, now fittingly named **To-do list card**, to support multiple
to-do lists. You can now select which to-do list you want to show on the card
you've put in your dashboard.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2023-11/todo-list-card.png' alt='Screenshot showing configuration of a to-do list card, that allows selecting the to-do list to display.'>

## Integrations providing your to-dos

But wait! There is more besides local to-do lists and shopping lists.
Now we have a to-do entity, we can also start using it with other integrations
that, for example, can get your to-do lists from an external service.

As of this release, you can bring in your [Todoist] and [Google Tasks]
to-do lists to Home Assistant as well!

This is awesome, as it brings all these to-do lists together in one place, and
above all, provides you with the power of Home Assistant to automate on them.

[Todoist]: /integrations/todoist
[Google Tasks]: /integrations/google_tasks

## Customize the information shown in your Tile cards

Tile card now displays the entity's state information on the card.
But what if you want to display something else? [@piitaya] to the rescue!

You can now customize it to your liking. Show the entity's state, any of its
attributes, or a combination of both!

<p class='img'>
<img src='/images/blog/2023-11/customize-tile-card-state-content.png'></a>
You can add any attribute of the entity to the state content of the tile card.
</p>

This not only works for the climate entities but for all entities! You could,
for example, add the brightness % of a light or the battery level of a sensor.
Simply add the attribute to the state content and drag and drop them in the
order you want them to appear.

[@piitaya]: https://github.com/piitaya

## Matter 1.2 is here!

The Connectivity Standards Alliance has launched
[version 1.2 of the Matter specification](https://csa-iot.org/newsroom/matter-1-2-arrives-with-nine-new-device-types-improvements-across-the-board/),
together with a new version of the Official Matter SDK, which is not only
prepared for new device types but also contains all kinds of smaller
stability- and bug fixes.

<center><img src='/images/supported_brands/matter.png' alt='Matter logo' class='no-shadow'></center><br>

Although you can only benefit from the new device types once actual devices are
released, we have upgraded our Matter implementation to version 1.2 to benefit
from the stability improvements and to be prepared for the new device types.

**Interesting fact**: Did you know that Home Assistant is used as a test
platform by many device manufacturers? This potentially means that devices will
be implemented and tested on the Home Assistant Matter controller before
others; cool!

## Custom date ranges in the energy dashboard!

The energy dashboard now allows you to select a custom date range. This allows
you to see the energy usage of your home over a specific period.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2023-11/date-range-energy-dashboard.png' alt='Screenshot showing the energy dashboard, which now allows you to select a custom date range.'>

Thanks, [@TillFleisch]!

## New conditions for the conditional card

The [conditional card](/dashboards/conditional/) is a great way to show or hide
cards conditionally. For example, you can show a card only when the sun is
setting, or when you are home.

When using such a state, you also match it against multiple values. For example,
you can show a card when the sun is setting or when the sun is below the
horizon in a single condition.

But even more interesting, [@piitaya] added a whole bunch of new conditions
to this card for you to use!

[@piitaya]: https://github.com/piitaya

### User condition <!-- omit in toc -->

The user condition allows you to show or hide cards based on the user that is
currently logged in. This is useful if you have multiple users in your Home
Assistant instance and want to show or hide cards based on who is logged in.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2023-11/conditional-card-per-user.png' alt='Screenshot showing the configuration dialog of the conditional card, which now allows you to set which users to show the card at.'>

### Numeric state condition <!-- omit in toc -->

Similar to the state condition, the numeric state condition allows you to show
or hide cards based on the state of a numeric entity. This is useful if you
want to show or hide cards based on the temperature, humidity, or any other
numeric entity.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2023-11/conditional-card-numeric-state.png' alt='Screenshot showing the configuration dialog of the conditional card, which you can now configure an numeric condition on when to show the card.'>

### Screen condition <!-- omit in toc -->

Last but not least, the screen condition allows you to show or hide cards based
on the screen size of the device you are viewing Home Assistant on.

For example, you could show some cards only when viewing Home Assistant on a
desktop or tablet, and hide them when viewing Home Assistant on a mobile device.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2023-11/conditional-card-screen-type.png' alt='Screenshot showing the configuration dialog of the conditional card, which you can now configure an numeric condition on when to show the card.'>

## Restarting into safe mode

You can now restart Home Assistant in safe mode. This mode will disable all
custom integrations and custom frontend resources (for example, custom cards
and themes).

It is useful if you are experiencing issues with your Home Assistant and want to
quickly rule out custom integrations or custom dashboard resources as the cause
of these issues.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2023-11/restart-in-safe-mode.png' alt='Screenshot showing the restart dialog, which now provides a new option: Restart Home Assistant in safe mode.'>

Want to get out of safe mode again? Just restart Home Assistant one more time,
and everything will be back to normal.

This is helpful! Thanks, [@emontnemery]!

[@emontnemery]: https://github.com/emontnemery

## Set up Improv devices directly from Home Assistant!

If you bought a device that supports [Improv Wi-Fi](https://improv-wifi.com/)
over Bluetooth, and you are using Bluetooth in Home Assistant, you can now
set up your device directly from Home Assistant itself!

Plug in the power of your brand-new device, and Home Assistant will discover
it and help you set it up by connecting it to your Wi-Fi network and adding 
it to Home Assistant.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2023-11/improv-wifi.png' alt='Screenshot showing a discovered Improv Wi-Fi device over Bluetooth, which can be set up and added to your Wi-Fi network straight from Home Assistant.'>

[Improv Wi-Fi](https://improv-wifi.com/) is a fully open standard that can
be freely adopted and implemented by any hardware creator, no matter how big
or small. Improv Wi-Fi is also supported by [ESPHome](https://esphome.io/components/esp32_improv#improv-via-ble).

Nice job on this one [@emonemery]!

## Configuring script fields for your script in the UI

Scripts have a really cool feature: fields. Fields allow you to define
variables in your script you can pass in when calling your script as a service,
which you can then use in your script. For example, you could create a script
that sends a notification to a specific person, and use a field to define the
message you want to send.

<p class='img'>
<img src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32912880/276089825-a3c1587c-d446-4a03-a79b-d4f6b0373924.png'></a>
Temporary screenshot that needs to be replaced.
</p>

## Country selector

A new selector is available, that allows you to select a country. This is
selector can be used in your Blueprints, or, in the new script field editor
mentioned above. Thanks, [@gjohansson-ST]!

<p class='img'>
<img src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62932417/273396112-687c0d44-be26-4ce9-ac68-89495bfa61a7.png'></a>
Temporary screenshot that needs to be replaced.
</p>

## Type checking in your templates

Last, but not least, [@raman325] extended our template engine with the ability
to check the type of a variable. This allows you to do things like:

{% raw %}

```yaml
{% if my_var is list %}
  # Do something
{% endif %}
```

and

```yaml
{% if my_var is datetime %}
  # Do something
{% endif %}
```

{% endraw %}

Read more about [complex type checking in our documentation](/docs/configuration/templating/#complex-type-checking).

## Other noteworthy changes

## Breaking changes

{% details "Demo" %}

In the unlikely event that you are using the demo integration, you will need to
ensure that your YAML configuration for demo integration is only enabled via
the integration domain key and not via the entity platform configuration. The
latter has been removed.

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml

# This is correct
demo:

# This no longer works and should be removed
light:
  - platform: demo
```

[@gjohansson-ST]: https://github.com/gjohansson-ST
[#100867]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/100867

{% enddetails %}

{% details "OpenUV" %}

The OpenUV "UV Level" sensor has updated its possible state values so that
translations can occur. The new values are:

- `extreme`
- `high`
- `low`
- `moderate`
- `very_high`

If you previously used the state values of this sensor in your automations,
you will need to update them to use the new values.

[#101978]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/101978

{% enddetails %}

{% details "OpenWeatherMap" %}

The OpenWeatherMap rain and snow sensors now have a different unit
of measurement (`mm/h` instead of `mm`) and a different device
class (`precipitation_itensity` instead of `precipitation`).

[#101485]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/101485

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Transmission" %}

The option to set a custom polling interval has been removed. If are using
custom interval and really need it, you can use the `homeassistant.update_entity`
in an automation to poll at your custom pace. See our documentation on
[defining a custom polling interval](https://www.home-assistant.io/common-tasks/general/#defining-a-custom-polling-interval)
for more information.

{% enddetails %}

{% details "V√§sttrafik" %}

V√§sttrafik has upgraded all infrastructure for handling external access,
including handling user accounts for 3rd party applications.

This means that users of the older infrastructure now need to migrate to use
the new environment. Create a new account at
[https://developer.vasttrafik.se](https://developer.vasttrafik.se),
then [create a new application](https://developer.vasttrafik.se/applications)
and subscribe to the Planera Resa v4 API.

Next replace your old client identifier and secret in your Home Assistant
configuration.

For more information, see [this official post](https://developer.vasttrafik.se/news/3) from V√§sttrafik.

{% details "WeatherFlow" %}

The VOC device class has been removed from the air density sensor, and
its unit of measurement has been changed to kg/m¬≥.

[@natekspencer]: https://github.com/natekspencer
[#101777]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/101777

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Withings" %}

The Withings sleep sensors will now show only the data from last night instead
of an aggregation of the data since the day before noon.

([@joostlek] - [#101993]) ([documentation](/integrations/withings))

[@joostlek]: https://github.com/joostlek
[#101993]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/101993

{% enddetails %}

{% details "World Air Quality Index (WAQI)" %}

The state attributes of the WAQI air quality sensor have been moved to their own
sensors. The previous state attributes are now deprecated and will be removed in
2024.5.

If you are using the state attributes of the WAQI air quality sensor, you will
need to update your automations to use the new sensors.

([@joostlek] - [#101217]) ([documentation](/integrations/waqi))

[@joostlek]: https://github.com/joostlek
[#101217]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/101217

{% enddetails %}

{% details "ZHA (King of Fans)" %}

Improved support for King of Fans (Hampton Bay) breaks previous workarounds
such as template fans ([example](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/king-of-fans-mr101z-missing-max-setting/267131/45))
or automations/scripts that set fan speed percentage or preset.

If you have an automation that sets speed, it will now be at one speed higher.
If you set the speed at 100% before, it would actually set the speed at 75%,
but now it will be 100%. If you have an automation that sets the preset to
'on' to get 100% speed, now the request will fail, and you will have to
change the speed to 100% instead.

[#101859]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/101859

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Z-Wave" %}

With this release, you will need to update your zwave-js-server instance.
You must use zwave-js-server `1.33.0` or greater (schema `33`).

  - If you use the Z-Wave JS add-on, you need at least version `0.2.1`.
  - If you use the Z-Wave JS UI add-on, you need at least version `2.2.3`.
  - If you use the Z-Wave JS UI Docker container, you need at least version `9.2.3`.
  - If you run your own Docker container or some other installation method,
    you will need to update your zwave-js-server instance to at least `1.33.0`.

---

Basic Command Class values were previously exposed as `number` entities and
were disabled by default. They are now exposed as `light` entities
and are enabled by default.

If you have scripts or automations that use any of these `number` entities,
they should be updated to use the new `light` entities instead. Any previously
created `number` entities for this Command Class can safely be deleted once
you have validated that your scripts and automations are up to date.

## Farewell to the following

The following integrations are also no longer available as of this release:

- **Eight Sleep** has been removed. The API has changed and is no longer
  accessible, making the integration unusable.
  ([@raman325] - [#102669])
- **IMAP email content** has been removed. This functionality is now available
  in the [IMAP] integration. Users have been assisted to migrate to the new
  integration in the past months.
  ([@jbouwh] - [#101233])
